# Memory Game Project
This is a simple game built to test a user's memory. There's a deck of cards with different positive affirmations.

## How I Built the Memory Game
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created this project using data-attribute, positioning, perspective, transitions, flexbox, event handling, timeouts, and ternaries.

* Game board displays all of the current cards face down in a random order.
* Cards flip when the user clicks on them.
* If a pair of matching cards have been selected, cards are removed from the game
board after a short time.
* If a pair of cards does not match, they flip back to being face down after
a short time.
* For flipping the cards, no libraries or plugins were used. Just pure JavaScript.

## Your Challenge
Simply match cards. 

## How to Play
1. Pull repo.
2. Load HTML file on Live Server through text editor or copy HTML path onto browser's address window. 

## Instructions to Play
1. Click on a card to reveal.
2. Keep revealing cards and work your memory to remember each unveiled card.
3. Match cards correctly until all cards are matched and removed from game board.

## Project Status
Uncompleted tasks:
- [ ] A functional reset button
- [ ] A timer that starts after the first card is clicked and stops after the last card is removed from the game board
